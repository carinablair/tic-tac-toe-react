Followed this React [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) to learn the latest changes with React. Using  TypeScript and Yarn instead of NPM. 
React version ^16.9.0

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Creating your own tic-tac-toe project with Yarn and TypeScript

1. Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js -  https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

2. Run `yarn create react-app tic-tac-toe --typescript`

yarn create react-app tic-tac-toeÂ is equivalent to:
`$ yarn global add create-react-app`
`$ create-react-app tic-tac-toe`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory (i.e inside `tic-tac-toe` directory ), you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
